# Dimensionality Reduction
Whatever is the original number of our independent variables, we can often end up with two independent variables by applying an appropriate Dimensionality Reduction technique

**There are two types of Dimensionality Reduction techniques**

# Feature Selection
Feature Selection techniques are:
* Backward Elimination
* Forward Selection
* Bidirectional Elimination
* Score Comparison and more

We covered these techniques in [Part 2 - Regression.](Machine_Learning_A-Z_Mine/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%2010%20-%20Evaluating%20Regression%20Models%20Performance/notes.md)

# Feature Extraction

In this part we will cover the following Feature Extraction techniques:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Kernel PCA
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
