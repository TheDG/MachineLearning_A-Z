# Intro
Natural Language Processing (or NLP) is applying Machine Learning models to text and language. Teaching machines to understand what is said in spoken and written word is the focus of Natural Language Processing. Most of NLP algorithms are classification models

### Potential Applications
- Convert speech to text
- Sentiment Analysis
- Predict some categories / genres of the text you are trying to segment
- Machine translator or a speech recognition system

# Bag of Words Model
Model used to preprocess the texts to classify before fitting the classification algorithms on the observations containing the texts. Converts text into our dependent variables!
- Creates a Spare Matrix
  - Rows are the elements of texts
  - Columns are the words(or stems)
  - A 1 in cell [i,j] represents that the word / stem j is present in tex row / text element i

# Algorithm | Models to Apply once Data is Preprocessed
Most common algorithms are the Naive Bayes and Random Forrest Classification algorithms.
